# Computer-Science-101
My notes about computer science


###  1. Objectives

* To review the ideas of computer science, programming and algorithms.
* To understand abstraction
* To review the Python programming language


### 1.2 Introduction
Technology has changed our society. It created a huge impact on our lives. Changes in computing technology provided us with growing number of tools and platforms. Despite of this rapid evolution, a number of basic principles have remained constant.

### 1.3 What is computer Science?
Computer science is not a study of computers. It is the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solution to those problems. Given any problem a computer scientist's goal is to create an algorithm, a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of that problem. Algorithms are finite process. Algorithms are solutions.

Computer science focuses on abstraction. Abstraction allows us to view the problem and solution in a way separate from it's implementation.

### 1.4 What is programming ?

Programming is the process implementing algorithms into a notation or program. Programming is the way of creating representation of algorithms. Without algorithms a program can not exist.

### 1.5 Data Structures and Abstract Data Types

Computer scientist uses abstraction to manage the complexity of problems and the problem-solving process. Abstraction is the process of creating models of the problem domain. These models allow us to describe the data that our algorithms will manipulate in a much more consistent way.

An abstract data type is a logical description on how we view the data and the operations that are allowed.

The implementation of an abstract data type is referred to a data structure. It requires a physical view of the data using some primitive data types.


### 1.6 Algorithms

Algorithms are the solution to problems. Algorithms are often different from one way to another. An algorithm can be faster or use fewer resources that others. Algorithms are often evaluated with time and space complexity.


### 1.7 Basics of Python

Python is the most popular programming language in 2019. It is a general-purpose programming language. It is used in different industries and being applied to different tools. It is capable of doing system programming, machine learning, data visualization, web development, automation, scientific computation, datascience and etc.

An example of hello world in python
``` python
print('Hello World')
```


### Data types
Python has two numeric data types integer and float. These datatypes have standard arithmetic operations. `+,-,*,/ and **(exponentiation)` . Numeric data types also supports the (modulo) operator `%` and integer division `//`.


```python

print(2+3*4)
print((2+3)*4)
print(2**8)
print(7/4)
print(7//4)
print(7%4)
print(3/7)
print(3/6)
print(3//6)
print(3%6)
```
