### 1.2 Introduction
Technology has changed our society. It created a huge impact on our lives. Changes in computing technology provided us with growing number of tools and platforms. Despite of this rapid evolution, a number of basic principles have remained constant.

### 1.3 What is computer Science
Computer science is not a study of computers. It is the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solution to those problems. Given any problem a computer scientist's goal is to create an algorithm, a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of that problem. Algorithms are finite process. Algorithms are solutions.
